# DELIVERABLE 3 REPORT
### AUTHORS: Maria Azcona Garcia, Neus Fernández Valls, Eric Hernández Rodríguez & Marçal Piró Patau

## Introduction
This report outlines the implementation of Web 3.0 technologies in our project. The focus is
on the integration of Schema.org attributes and objects into HTML to enhance semantic
understanding and interoperability.

## Implementation of the Web 3.0
We have selected appropriate Schema.org types and properties that align with the content
and context of our web page. Applying these schemas within the HTML structure, we ensure
that each piece of content is annotated with relevant metadata. For this deliverable, we have
updated the next HTML files:
- edit_reservation
- list_movies
- base
- home
- list_reservations
- list_cinemas
- movie

The rest of the explanation can be found in the Campus Virtual activity file.

## Testing
The testing of the project has been implemented using validator.schema.org. We uploaded
the HTML files that we have modified and this tool automatically identified the elements
present in each file. The testing passed for all the files in the project.

The rest of the explanation can be found in the Campus Virtual activity file.
