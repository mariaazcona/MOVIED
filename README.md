Our website, named MOVIED, is based on a model of movie information and rating. Data such as TITLE (movie title), NAME (actor name), BUDGET, or RATING are implemented. In order to carry out this project, we have divided the work into two parts: front-end and back-end.

Regarding the front-end, the page focuses on both Log In and Sign Up. The Sign Up section checks password formats for security purposes. To facilitate navigation, we have added a header that displays the available options on all pages. Users can easily move around the site using the menu in the top bar.

As for the page's style, we aimed to contrast an image with different colors and shapes with a white frame to highlight the buttons. We have also included our logo on the website, as well as a button with the name MOVIED that redirects to the main page.

Concerning the back-end section, we have made slight alterations to the models presented in our initial web project proposal, resulting in this new class diagram:

Given our plans to integrate an API in the upcoming release, which will enable us to fetch comprehensive movie details, we foresee a shift in our data model towards prioritizing specific attributes of each movie. These attributes constitute the subset of data we intend to retain within our database infrastructure. Consequently, as a provisional measure for presentation purposes, we have embedded certain movie data directly within the current release.

In summary, the development of MOVIED has progressed significantly in this first deliverable. We have established a solid foundation both in the front-end and back-end, implementing key features such as user authentication and visually appealing design. Additionally, we have adapted our data model to accommodate future integrations, such as the use of an API to fetch detailed movie information. As we continue with development, we remain committed to maintaining the quality and usability of the platform, providing our users with an exceptional experience when interacting with MOVIED.
